/// Repeat a block of styles as a separate rule-set for each selector provided. Does not combine multiple selectors with commas.
/// Most often used with selectors like `:host` which do not work properly when combined with other selectors.
/// @param {list} $selectors - A SASS list of selectors
/// @example scss
///  @include repeat-rule(('bolt-link', ':host')) {
///    display: inline;
///  }
@mixin bolt-repeat-rule($selectors: null) {
  @each $selector in $selectors {
    #{$selector} {
      @content;
    }
  }
